# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a fully interactive dashboard that would be used to display Roza's research data. Her volunteers will be able to
use the dashboard to identify the top 10 bacteria species living in their belly button. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
